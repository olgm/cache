 * Builds construction sites in a sensible order (spawn → tower → extension →

 * and freshly-built ramparts). Idle builders help upgrade so they never waste a
 * tick. Gathers energy from buffers (never from spawn/extensions).

 * and storage first, instead of whatever site merely happens to be nearest.
 * (The builder's own pickSite adds bootstrap/controller-container nuance on top
 * of this base ordering.)
