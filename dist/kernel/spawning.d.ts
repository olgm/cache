/**
 * Cache — Spawn manager (per-room, prioritized, self-healing).

 * For each owned room with a free spawn it spawns the highest-priority missing
 * creep, sizing the body to the room's full energy capacity (so creeps grow with
 * the colony) and waiting until that body is affordable rather than producing
 * runts. The exception is the emergency path: if the room's energy-delivery
 * pipeline has collapsed (no harvesters AND no miners-or-haulers), it
 * immediately spawns a self-sufficient harvester sized to whatever energy is on
 * hand — the safety net that lets a colony recover from a wipe.
